  Hi, I’m Stefan Florea, a Senior Software Developer with over a decade of experience building scalable backend systems and serverless architectures, mostly in C++ and AWS (because someone has to enjoy memory management and IAM policies). 
  I focus on automating security workflows, streamlining CI/CD, and making backend infrastructure not only robust, but borderline enjoyable to maintain.

  Outside of writing code, I enjoy solo motorbike trips through Southeast Asia, because debugging life in remote villages builds character (and GPS skills). 
  I’m also an avid board gamer, with a soft spot for games so complex they come with a legal disclaimer. 
  When I’m not playing or traveling, I’m probably hacking together a side project—anything from indie game prototypes to security tools no one asked for but everyone needs.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>distributed systems</mark> and <mark>board games</mark>

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
